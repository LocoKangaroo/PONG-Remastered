# Pong Game in React 

## How to Play:
The left player uses the W and S keys to control the paddle and the right player uses the up and down arrow keys. Each time you score, you get a point. The first player who gets to 5 points wins. While playing, press pause to pause the game. When game is paused, you can either resume or restart. When a player reaches 5 points, you can also restart the game. You will only be able to change the background when you are not actively playing. Every time the ball hits the paddle, it will speed up so the game will progressively get faster and faster.
